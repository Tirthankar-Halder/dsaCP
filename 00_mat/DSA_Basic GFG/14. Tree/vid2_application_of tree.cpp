// Application of tree datastructure:
/*trie --used for ditionaries and prefix search

suffix tree = it is used to search pattern in a long text string
it divide into subtree and search them(search time == size pattern element)

Binary Index tree == used range quaries searches, it is faster for limited set of operations
segment tree do the same but it's more powerful
